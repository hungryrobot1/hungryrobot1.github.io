        <p>Hello, and thank you for visitng my humble website! I am a self-taught engineer with classical liberal arts background from <a href="https://www.sjc.edu/">St. John's College</a></p>
        <p>My passion is applying lessons from the history of philosophy, math, and science into systems design. I also enjoy researching the intersection between memetics and evolutionary biology/phylogenetics, particularly in how the semantic contents of memes behave like ribosomal RNA in organic life. I believe the machine learning can open the door for us to understand history through a new style of thinking called structured emergence. </p>
        <p>Outside of researching memetics, I also enjoy building developer tools which push the forntiers of human-AI collaboration. Currently I am working on two things: a developer tool called VIZARCH (short for "visual architecture" which combines the Monaco Editor, Jupyter-style notebook interfaces, and interactive visual diagrams for a novel approach to workflows software composition, and the standalone PIF (personal intelligence framework) which introduces a modular AI unit that treats the language model as a central executive function and is capable of performing actions, recall, and text generation concurrently. Periodically, I will apply updates to the MCP-PIF repository which is a proof-of-concept of the personal intelligence framework, built on Anthropic's Model Context Prototcol.</p>
