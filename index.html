    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <p>Hello, and thank you for visitng my website! I am a self-taught engineer with a classical liberal arts
            background from <a href="https://www.sjc.edu/">St. John's College</a>.</p>
        <p>My passion consists in applying various lessons from the history of philosophy, math, and science into
            systems
            design. I also enjoy doing research at the intersection of memetics, evolutionary biology, and
            phylogenetics: particularly in how the semantic contents of memes behave like ribosomal RNA in organic life.
            I
            believe that machine learning can open the door for us to understand history, memes, technology, and perhaps
            even life itself and the nature of consciousnes through a new lens.
        </p>
        <p>Outside of independent research, I also enjoy building developer tools that explore the frontiers of human-AI
            collaboration. Currently, I am primarily working on two things: one is a developer tool called VIZARCH
            (short for "visual architecture") which combines the Monaco Editor, Jupyter-style notebook interfaces, and
            interactive visual diagrams for a novel approach to software composition. The other is a standalone PIF
            (personal intelligence framework) which introduces a modular AI unit which treats the language model as a
            central executive function, and which is capable of performing actions, recall, and text generation
            concurrently. Periodically, I will also apply updates to the MCP-PIF repository, which is a proof-of-concept
            of the personal intelligence framework, built on Anthropic's Model Context Prototcol.</p>
